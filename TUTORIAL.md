**Soundscape Adventure Tutorial**

Welcome to the Soundscape Adventure tutorial! In this tutorial we will how the module works, initial configuration, creating soundscapes, setting up moods, and how to create sounds that can be used by all soundscapes.

### How the Module Works

The Soundscape Adventure module operates by reading a root folder that you select. Within this root folder, it treats each subfolder as a separate soundscape.

Soundscapes are collections of sounds that exhibit specific behaviors. There are three types of sounds:

1. **Ambience Sounds**: These are continuous sounds that play in the background, creating an immersive atmosphere.
2. **Loop Sounds**: These sounds also play continuously but are typically shorter and repeat more frequently compared to ambience sounds.
3. **Random Sounds**: These sounds play at random intervals, adding an element of unpredictability and variety to the soundscape.

Both Loop and Random sounds can be grouped. Detailed instructions on how to group sounds are covered in the "Groups of Sounds" section of this tutorial.

### Creating a Root Folder
When you enable the module in a world, it will prompt you to select its root folder. This root folder is where your soundscapes will live. If you choose a folder with existing soundscapes, they will be available in your world.

### Creating a Soundscape

Now that we have the root folder set up, let's create our first soundscape. In Soundscape Adventure, each subfolder within the root folder is treated as a separate soundscape.

For this example, we will create a soundscape named "Forest." Follow these steps to set up your forest-themed soundscape:

1. **Create a Folder:** Within the root folder, create a new folder named "Forest." This will be the main directory for your forest soundscape.

2. **Set Up Subfolders:** Inside the "Forest" folder, create three subfolders named:
   - **Loop**
   - **Random**
   - **Ambience**

These subfolders categorize the sounds based on their behavior:
- **Loop:** Sounds in this folder will play in a continuous loop.
- **Random:** Sounds in this folder will play at random intervals.
- **Ambience:** Sounds in this folder will play as background ambience.

At the end, your soundscape folder structure should look like this:

By organizing your sound files into these folders, you ensure that Soundscape Adventure can correctly identify and play them according to their intended behavior.


### Adding Sounds to the Soundscape
Since we have the folders, we need to start adding the sound files to their respecitivce folders. Let's add 3 sounds and refresh the page. After adding the sounds, it's time to load the soundscape.

### Creating Moods
Once the soundscape is available, you'll need to create a mood. Moods help organize sounds within a soundscape, such as for a sunny day or a rainy night.

To create a mood:
1. All sounds will be displayed in red, indicating they are disabled by default.
2. Increase the volume to enable a sound.

Play the mood, enable some sounds, and save your mood. This way, the next time you open this soundscape, the mood will have those sounds enabled, even in another world.

### Groups of Sounds
Now let's add more sounds. If you want a group of sounds to play randomly, create a group and add sounds to it. This is great for adding variety. For example, you can create a random group for animal sounds.

### Using Global Sounds

### Conclusion
These are the basic functions of the Soundscape Adventure. We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and that it helps you plan the next moods for your games.
